                    Code editors are a great tool for new developers because they offer many features that make our lives easier. For example, Visual Studio Code (my choice) will offer syntax suggestions so you can avoid simple typos that cause issues in your code. On top of that, it will autocomplete closing tags for HTML and add visual markers to your files so that you can easily tell different pieces of code apart.
